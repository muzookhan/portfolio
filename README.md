# **Data Analyst**

## **About me**

I decided to do my bachelors in Computer Science because I had a knack for problem solving but to be brutally honest, my true passion always lied in the arts (dance and theatre). You might think that's a weird way to open a Data Analyst portfolio, however at the risk of sounding cheesy, to me analytics is also a form of art. To understand this, consider the fact that a dancer and an analyst have overlapping skillsets. They both require creativity, excellent storytelling and strong technical skills achieved through practice. And I consider myself lucky to have realized and to be actually living this analogy.

While dance is something I've always loved, my first experience with data science was in my senior year. Our Final Year Project was to forecast energy load on the grid by individual houses in Lahore. With this exposure, I applied for Data Analyst positions and currently have 3+ years of experience doing analytics with start ups. Furthermore, this past year I have been enrolled in the Masters in Business Analytics program at Purdue on the Fulbright Scholarship.

With the completion of this degree, I am looking for new roles as a Data Analyst and feel excitement for all the professional growth and opportunities ahead! :rocket:
